CinemaModel

Description:
CinemaModel.py can be used to train sequence to sequence lstm based models for conversational AI.



Usage:
    python CinemaModel.py 
                            -train <name of model> <corpus file>
                                        OR
                            -load <path to model> <corpus file> <batch size> <epoch count>
                                        Optional
                            -bleu
                                This will randomly select input lines from the file to feed to
                                the encoder/decoder and will calculate the bleu score
Files:
root:
    cornell_corpus:
        1movie.txt          |   Index of lines from Conversations from 1 movie that can be used to train tiny model to test program
        72movies.txt        |   Index of lines from Conversations from multiple movies that can be used to train larger models
        movie_lines.txt     |   All the lines from all the movies to be referenced by previous 2 files
        All others are stray files from orignal database, left them there in case you wanted to browse through them
    Models:
        A collection of models trained with on the data set with varying Batch Sizes and Epoch ranges
        hugeModel is the best to load and test.

Prerequisites:
- tensorFlow (with Keras)
- nltk (for bleu scoring)
